\section{Setting Up}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least two decks should be used, shuffled together.  At present, jokers should be removed
  
\item At the beginning each player is dealt 7 cards
  
\item The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre of the table forming the `pick-up pile', and then the
  top card is turned over and placed next to the pile of cards, forming a discard pile.%
\footnote{n.b. this card is `dead'; none of the special meanings of cards apply (e.g.
no-one has to pick up 4 cards if it's an ace; \Sec{specialCards}) --- however, you 
may `butt-in' (\Sec{buttingIn}) in which case the butted-in card \textit{is}
live (so if it's an ace, the next player picks up 4, not 8, cards).}

\end{itemize}

\section{How to Play}

The idea of the game is to get rid of all your cards.  On each turn you usually attempt to play one card face up on to
the top of the discard pile; it must either be the same suit (e.g. hearts; spades) or number (e.g.  3; queen) as the
last card played.  The only exception to the follow-suit-or-number rule is a jack --- see \Sec{specialCards}.  If you
can't play (or don't wish to play) you must take a card from the pick-up pile.

Initially play passes to the left; the player to the dealer's left starts.
Players should be given time to sort their hands before the game commences; no
penalties may be extracted for being slow at this stage.

When you have only one card left\footnote{i.e. when you play the penultimate card}
you \emph{must} say ``Last Card'';  failure to do
so results in a penalty (see \Sec{penalties}).

When the pick-up pile is exhausted, turn over the discard pile (leaving the top card behind),
shuffle, and place face-down as a new pick-up pile.  No penalties may be extracted from the
shuffler while this is being done.

\section{The Meaning of Cards}
\label{specialCards}

In the following examples we assume that the players are $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ in order of play,
and $6_A$ means that $A$ plays a 6.  If you're in `Queens mode' the plays are indicated as e.g. $X_{A1} X_{A2} X_{B1}$,
where $A1$ means $A$'s leading hand.

We use the term, `hand' to refer to a turn --- usually a hand is the same as a player, but not when
you're in Queens mode.

\begin{description}
\newcommand{\card}[1]{\hbox to 15mm{#1\hfil}}
\item[\card{Ace}]
  The following hand must pick up four cards.  The player of the ace must say, ``Sorry'', although sincerity is neither required nor recommended.

  \item[\card{2}]
    The following hand must pick up two cards, or play another 2 in which case the next player must
    pick up four cards (or play a third 2 --- the number of cards to pick up increases only arithmetically)

  \item[\card{6}]
    The direction of play reverses immediately, just as if you'd played a King.  Then, after two
    more cards have been played it reverses again.  In the simple case this just goes backwards
    for 2 turns; If $C$ plays
    a 6, the result would be $6_C X_B X_A X_B X_C$.  Now consider what happens if a
    King's played;  you get $6_C K_B X_C X_B X_A$ or $6_C X_B K_A X_E X_D$.  With an 8,
    $6_C 8_B X_F X_A, X_B$.

    N.b. 6s apply to hands, not players.  In Queens mode, you might have $6_{C2} X_{C1} X_{B2} X_{C1} X_{C2}$

  \item[\card{7}]
    The next card played must be 5 or less.  N.b. Aces are low and may therefore be played following a 7;
    7s and Jacks are not 5 or less.

    As a variant, black 7s must be followed by 5 or less, while red 7s must be followed by 9 or more.

  \item[\card{8}]
    The next hand is skipped, e.g. $8_C X_E X_F$.

  \item[\card{9}]
    The play shifts to the previous player and immediately reverses again: $9_C X_B X_C X_D$

    N.b. 9s apply to players, not hands: $9_{C1} X_{B1} X_{B2} X_{C1}$

  \item[\card{10}]
    Every other hand is skipped until another 10 is played: $10_C X_E X_B X_D$.  If there are an even number of
    players, this leads to only half the players getting a chance to play until another
    10 is played (or a 9; e.g.  $10_C X_E X_B 9_D X_C X_F X_A$)

    When going into 10s mode (i.e. starting to skip) the player must say, ``in''; when playing a
    10 that leaves 10s mode the player must say, ``out''.  Failure to do so results, of course,
    in picking up a penalty card.

  \item[\card{Jack}]
    A Jack may be played even if it doesn't follow suit or number.  There are two situations
    that a Jack may \emph{not} be played:  after a (black) 7, and as a player's last card.

    You \emph{must} announce the suit that the Jack represents (it may be the same as the
    current suit, or that of the Jack, if you so desire);  in other words after a Jack of
    hearts, if the player announces, ``Spades'' you must follow with a spade, or another Jack.

    When butting-in on a Jack, you may play either a Jack of the face-value or nomininated suit.

  \item[\card{Queen}]
    In Queens mode, each player plays twice, once for their `leading' and once for their
    `trailing' hand.

    When going into Queens mode (i.e. starting to play two hands per player) the player must say, ``in''; when playing
    the Queen that leaves Queens mode the player must say, ``out''.  Failure to do so is rewarded by picking up a
    penalty card.

    Note that the combination of 10s and Queens mode feels normal at first sight as each player plays a single hand in
    turn.  However, when another 10 is played requires knowledge of whether you were playing on leading or trailing
    hands: $X_{A1} X_{B1} X_{C1} 10_{D1} X_{D2} X_{E1} X_{E2}$ but $X_{A2} X_{B2} X_{C2} 10_{D2} X_{E1} X_{E2}$

  \item[\card{King}]
    The direction of play is reversed: $X_C K_D X_C X_A$.  In Queens mode, this can result in playing
    three hands in succession: $X_C2 X_B1 K_B2 X_B1 X_C2$.

\end{description}

\section{Butting in}
\label{buttingIn}

    Butting in in Queens mode is always considered to be a play from the leading hand.

\section{Penalties}
\label{penalties}

Penalty cards are awarded for all errors;  when something must be done promptly (e.g. saying ``Sorry'' or
``Last card'') this must be done before the next player plays.
