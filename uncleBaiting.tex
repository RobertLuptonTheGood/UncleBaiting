\section{Setting Up}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least two decks should be used, shuffled together.  At present, jokers should be removed
  
\item At the beginning each player is dealt 7 cards
  
\item The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre of the table forming the `pick-up pile', and then the
  top card is turned over and placed next to the pile of cards, forming a discard pile.%
\footnote{n.b. this card is `dead'; none of the special meanings of cards apply (e.g.
no-one has to pick up 4 cards if it's an ace; \Sec{specialCards}) --- however, you 
may `butt-in' (\Sec{buttingIn}) in which case the butted-in card \textit{is}
live (so if it's an ace, the next player picks up 4, not 8, cards).}

\end{itemize}

\section{How to Play}

The idea of the game is to get rid of all your cards.  On each turn you usually attempt to play one card face up on to
the top of the discard pile; it must either be the same suit (e.g. hearts; spades) or number (e.g.  3; queen) as the
last card played.  The only exception to the follow-suit-or-number rule is a jack --- see \Sec{specialCards}.  If you
can't play (or don't wish to play) you must take a card from the pick-up pile.

Initially play passes to the left; the player to the dealer's left starts.
Players should be given time to sort their hands before the game commences; no
penalties may be extracted for being slow at this stage.

When you have only one card left\footnote{i.e. when you play the penultimate card}
you \emph{must} say ``Last Card'';  failure to do
so results in a penalty (see \Sec{penalties}).

When the pick-up pile is exhausted, turn over the discard pile (leaving the top card behind),
shuffle, and place face-down as a new pick-up pile.  No penalties may be extracted from the
shuffler while this is being done.

\section{The Meaning of Cards}
\label{specialCards}

\begin{description}
\newcommand{\card}[1]{\hbox to 7mm{#1\hfil}}
\item[\card{Ace}]
  The following player must pick up four cards.  The player of the ace must say, ``Sorry'', although sincerity is neither required nor recommended.

  \item[\card{2}]
    The following player must pick up two cards, or play another 2 in which case the next player must
    pick up four cards (or play a third 2 --- the number of cards to pick up increases only arithmetically)

\end{description}

\section{Butting in}

\section{Penalties}
\label{penalties}

Penalty cards are awarded for all errors;  when something must be done promptly (e.g. saying ``Sorry'' or
``Last card'') this must be done before the next player plays.
