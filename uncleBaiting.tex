  \textbf{\Large The Rules of Uncle Baiting}
\end{center}

Although the game's called Uncle Baiting, it's perfectly permissible to bait Aunts, Nieces, Nephews,
Cousins, Sons, Daughters, and Friends --- even Grandparents;  this is an equal-opportunity game.

\section{Setting Up}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least two decks should be used, shuffled together.  At present jokers should be removed (but
  see \Sec{proposedChanges}).
  
\item At the beginning each player is dealt 7 cards.
  
\item The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre of the table forming the `pick-up pile'.
  When everyone is ready the dealer turns over the 
  top card and places it next to the pickup-pile forming a discard pile;%
\footnote{n.b. this card is `dead'; none of the special meanings of cards apply (e.g.
no-one has to pick up 4 cards if it's an ace; \Sec{specialCards}); if you 
`butt-in' (\Sec{buttingIn}) the butted-in card is also dead.}
the game has begun.

\end{itemize}

\section{How to Play}

The idea of the game is to get rid of all your cards.  On each turn you usually attempt to play one card face up on to
the top of the discard pile; it must either be the same suit (e.g. hearts; spades) or number (e.g.  3; Queen) as the
last card played.  The only exception to the follow-suit-or-number rule is a Jack --- see \Sec{specialCards}.  If you
can't play (or don't wish to play) you must take a card from the pick-up pile.

Initially play passes to the left; the player to the dealer's left starts.
Players should be given time to sort their hands before the game commences; no
penalties may be extracted for being slow at this stage.

When you have only one card left\footnote{i.e. when you play the penultimate card}
you \emph{must} say ``Last Card'';  failure to do
so results in a penalty (see \Sec{penalties}).

When the pick-up pile is exhausted, turn over the discard pile (leaving the top card behind), shuffle, and place
face-down as a new pick-up pile.  Put the old top card on top, and resume play.  No penalties may be extracted from the
shuffler while this is being done.

\section{The Meaning of Cards}
\label{specialCards}

Some, well most, cards are special.  If the card that's just been discarded is special you
may be required to do something other than simply discard yourself.

In the following examples we assume that the players are $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ in order of play,
and $6_A$ means that $A$ plays a 6.  If you're in `Queens mode' the plays are indicated as e.g. $X_{A1} X_{A2} X_{B1}$,
where $A1$ means $A$'s leading hand, in other words the hand that plays first.

We use the term `hand' to refer to a turn --- usually a hand is the same as a player, but not when
you're in Queens mode.

\begin{description}
\newcommand{\card}[1]{\hbox to 15mm{#1\hfil}}
\item[\card{Ace}] The following hand must pick up four cards.  The player of the ace must say ``Sorry'', although
  sincerity is neither required nor recommended.  If a player goes out with an ace they must still say ``Sorry''
  otherwise they will be required to pick up a penalty and the game continues.

  \item[\card{2}]
    The following hand must pick up two cards, or play another 2 in which case the next player must
    pick up four cards (or play a third 2 --- the number of cards to pick up increases only arithmetically).

  \item[\card{6}]
    The direction of play reverses immediately, just as if you'd played a King.  Then, after two
    more hands have been played it reverses again.  In the simple case this means that play just goes backwards
    for two turns; If $C$ plays
    a 6, the result would be $6_C X_B X_A X_B X_C$.  Now consider what happens if a
    King's played;  you get $6_C K_B X_C X_B X_A$ or $6_C X_B K_A X_E X_D$.  With an 8,
    $6_C 8_B X_F X_A, X_B$.

    N.b. 6s apply to hands, not players.  In Queens mode, you might have $6_{C2} X_{C1} X_{B2} X_{C1} X_{C2}$.

  \item[\card{7}] The next card played must be 5 or less if the 7 is red; Jack or higher if the 7's black.
    N.b. Aces are low and may therefore be played following a red 7; 7s and Jacks are not 5 or less.%
    \footnote{The reason for the apparently asymmetrical ranges of permitted cards (Ace ... 5 v. Jack ... King)
    is that in fact there are four possible Jacks that can be played, so the ranges really are almost
    equal --- five cards against six.}

  \item[\card{8}]
    The next hand is skipped, e.g. $8_C X_E X_F$.

  \item[\card{9}]
    The play shifts to the previous player and immediately reverses again: $9_C X_B X_C X_D$.

    N.b. 9s apply to players, not hands: in Queens mode, $9_{C1} X_{B1} X_{B2} X_{C1}$.

  \item[\card{10}]
    Every other hand is skipped until another 10 is played: $10_C X_E X_B X_D$.  If there are an even number of
    players, this leads to only half the players getting a chance to play until another
    10 is played (or a 9; e.g.  $10_C X_E X_B 9_D X_C X_F X_A$).

    When going into 10s mode (i.e. starting to skip) the player must say, ``In''; when playing a
    10 that leaves 10s mode the player must say, ``Out''.  Failure to do so results, of course,
    in picking up a penalty card.  A player whose last card is a 10 must still say ``In'' or ``Out''
    before the game is over.

  \item[\card{Jack}]
    A Jack may be played even if it doesn't follow suit or number.  There are two situations
    when a Jack may \emph{not} be played:  after a red 7, and as a player's last card.

    You \emph{must} announce the suit that the Jack represents (it may be the same as the
    current suit, or that of the Jack, if you so desire);  in other words after a Jack of
    Hearts, if the player announces ``Spades'' you must follow with a spade, or another Jack.

    If you fail to announce the new suit the next player may play a card of any suit other than the Jack's own suit.%
    \footnote{The rationale for requiring a change of suit is to minimise the chance that
      a careless player will make a correct play by mistake.}
    After the penalty for not naming a suit has been duly awarded, play continues from the card on the top of the
    discard pile --- the owner of the Jack has missed their chance to choose a new suit.

  \item[\card{Queen}]
    In Queens mode, each player plays twice, once for their `leading' and once for their
    `trailing' hand --- the leading hand plays first.

    When going into Queens mode (i.e. starting to play two hands per player) the player must say, ``In''; when playing
    the Queen that leaves Queens mode the player must say, ``Out'', even in the Queen is the the player's
    last card. Failure to do so is rewarded by picking up a penalty card.  

    Note that the combination of 10s and Queens mode feels normal at first sight as each player plays a single hand in
    turn.  However, when another 10 is played you need to know whether you were playing on leading or trailing
    hands: $X_{A1} X_{B1} X_{C1} 10_{D1} X_{D2} X_{E1} X_{E2}$ but $X_{A2} X_{B2} X_{C2} 10_{D2} X_{E1} X_{E2}$.

  \item[\card{King}]
    The direction of play is reversed: $X_C K_D X_C X_B$.  In Queens mode, this can result in playing
    three hands in succession: $X_{C2} X_{B1} K_{B2} X_{B1} X_{C2}$.

\end{description}

\section{Butting in}
\label{buttingIn}

Uncle baiting is always played with at least two packs of cards, which means that there
are duplicates of all cards (e.g. two Queens of Hearts).  When a card is played and you
have an identical one in your hand, you may always play it --- this is known as `Butting In'.
Following a butt-in play proceeds as if you'd been the original player of the card, and
the butt-in does \emph{not} count as a separate play (an important point when considering
6s and 9s).

In two cases, the butt-in augments rather than replaces the original card:
an Ace or a 2.  As soon as an Ace is played the next hand starts to pick up
four cards;  when the butted-in Ace is played the player after the butter-in
must pick up the remainder of the initial four cards, and also four cards for
the second Ace;  the butter-in is required to say ``Sorry'' as usual.  You
may choose to butt-in at any time before the player following
the original picker-upper plays.   Butting in with a 2 is similar;  the balance
of cards being picked up by the initial victim is transferred to the player
after the butter-in, along with an extra two for the butted-in 2.

When butting-in on a Jack, you may play either a Jack of the face-value or nominated suit. For
example, after a Jack of Hearts announced as ``Spades'' you may butt-in with either
a Jack of Hearts or a Jack of Spades.

Butting in in Queens mode is always considered to be a play from the trailing hand (i.e. you
don't get to play a second card).

\section{Penalties}
\label{penalties}

Penalty cards are awarded for all errors;  when something must be done promptly (e.g. saying ``Sorry'' or
``Last card'') this must be done before the next player plays.  Picking up a penalty doesn't
end your turn;  after accepting it you must still play or pick up.

Examples of errors are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Playing slowly;  the definition of `slowly' is left to the consensus of the other players.

  \item Attempting to play when it isn't your turn (e.g. if the player before you plays an 8).

  \item Playing an illegal card (e.g. not following suit-or-number;  playing a Jack on a 7).

  \item Making a mistake even if the card was played illegally;  e.g. playing an Ace on a
    black 7 and forgetting to say ``Sorry'' would result in two penalty cards (plus potentially
    a third for arguing).

  \item Asking for clarification of the state of play;  after the card is awarded the
    clarification should be given.

  \item Explaining the state of play until the information's been bought with a penalty.
    
  \item Dropping hints about cards that should be played.

  \item Being too officious about awarding penalty cards (the definition of `too' is
    to be decided by majority vote of the players).

  \item Failing to say ``Sorry'', ``In'', or ``Out'' as required when you triumphantly play your last card.  This is an
    especially satisfactory penalty, as it means that the game isn't over after all.
\end{itemize}

Once a penalty card has been awarded it may not be returned to the pickup-pile.  If it found that the award was
incorrect or unjust the penalty is given to the person who originally proposed it.

\section{Uncle Baiting Junior}
\label{Junior}

As a gentle introduction for new Uncle Baiters, it's possible to play just a subset of the full rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only Ace, 2, 7, 8, Jack, and King are special.

  \item All 7s are treated as being red (i.e. to be followed by 5 or less).
\end{itemize}

\section{Uncle Baiting Classic}
\label{Classic}

When Uncle Baiting came into the family it was a rather different game.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Only Ace, 2, 8, Jack, and King were special.

  \item Penalties were not enforced.

  \item There was no butting-in.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Changes to the Rules}
\label{proposedChanges}

Uncle Baiting is an evolving game.  The following suggestions have been made, but
either not accepted, or we've been too scared to try them:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Split the players into two groups, initially the `even' and `odd' players counting round the table.
      \item Split the discard pile into two separate piles, one for each group.
      \item Each group plays a separate game of Uncle Baiting;  the first player to
        win either group is the overall winner.
      \item A player may butt-in to either group;  he or she then becomes a member of
        that group.
    \end{itemize}

    N.b. We haven't tried this one yet    

  \item
    Jokers

    Jokers may not be played by themselves, but
    one or more jokers may be played along with any legal card; each joker has the effect of
    skipping one hand.  For example, if player A plays a Joker and 2, $({J^k} 2)_A$, C must pick up 2 cards
    or play a 2 herself;  she is of course at liberty to play $({J^k} {J^k} 2)_C$ to make A pick up 4 cards.
    You may butt in on a card played with a joker, but not on the joker itself.

    A joker may not be played along with a player's last card.
    
    N.b. We haven't tried this one yet    
\end{itemize}
