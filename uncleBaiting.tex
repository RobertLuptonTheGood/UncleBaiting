\section{Setting Up}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least two decks should be used, shuffled together.  At present, jokers should be removed
  
\item At the beginning each player is dealt 7 cards
  
\item The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre of the table, and then the
  top card turned over

  \begin{itemize}
    \item N.b. This card is `dead'; none of the special meanings of cards apply (e.g.
      no-one has to pick up 4 cards if it's an ace) --- however, you 
      may `butt-in' (\Sec{buttingIn}) in which case the butted-in card \textit{is}
      live (so if it's an ace, pick up 4, not 8).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{How to Play}

The idea of the game is to get rid of all your cards.

Initially play passes to the left; the player to the dealer's left starts.  Each player in
turn may play a card that matches either number or suit.

\section{The Meaning of Cards}

\begin{description}
\item[Ace]
  The following player must pick up four cards.  The player of the ace must say, ``Sorry'' although sincerity is neither required nor recommended.

  \item[2]
    The following player must pick up two cards, or play another 2 in which case the next player must
    pick up four cards (or play a third 2 --- the number of cards to pick up increases only arithmetically)
